#mock-8

A mock community composed of 67 bacteria represented in equal abundances in three replicate samples. These are the same community members present in [mock-7](../mock-7), which consists of the same mock community samples analyzed on different Illumina sequencing runs. This was generated by Dr. Peter Turnbaugh at Harvard in 2012.

Previously called dataset B8 in [Bokulich et al. 2015](https://dx.doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.934v2).

#Known Issues / Notes

Note:
These barcode reads contain golay barcodes, and the mapping barcodes need to be reverse-complemented to match the reads. Run in qiime-1 using the following command:
``split_libraries_fastq.py -i mock-forward-read.fastq.gz -o split_libraries -m sample-metadata.tsv -b mock-index-read.fastq.gz --rev_comp_barcodes``

The original QUAL scores for the index/barcode reads were not recovered, and thus mock-index-read.fastq.gz contains artificial index/barcode QUAL scores. QUAL scores from all other files are original.
