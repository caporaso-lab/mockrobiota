#mock-17

Mock metagenome community generated by Kozich et al. dual indexing V4 HMP mock, composed of even amounts of purified genomic DNA from 21 bacterial strains.

The dataset formerly known as Kozich Mock 1 — metagenome.

This is a shotgun metagenome dataset of evenly mixed bacterial strains identical to those in marker-gene communities [mock-3](../mock-3/), [mock-4](../mock-4/), [mock-5](../mock-5/), [mock-13](../mock-13/), [mock-14](../mock-14/), and [mock-15](../mock-15/).

#Known Issues / Notes

No barcodes. Treat this dataset as already demultiplexed, but not quality controlled.

Note: original references sequences were downloaded from [mothur](https://www.mothur.org/MiSeqDevelopmentData.html). Additional sequencing runs containing this mock community are available at that site.

Currently, this dataset contains taxonomy annotations but gene annotations have not yet been contributed.
